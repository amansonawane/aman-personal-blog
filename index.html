                    content: `<p>hey. i'm writing a new blog after a very long time. i still have around 3-4 drafts lying around in my docs which i might post someday. this is meant to be a decently long read as i will attempt to cover everything that has been happening in my life since the last few months.</p><p>i'm not a very "social media" person by any means. i hate posting on instagram but i have recently started being active on x and reddit for my side project (more on that later). in this blog though, i will try to be extremely candid and vulnerable about stuff. the goal of posting this blog is to:</p><p>i. try to collect/ organize my thoughts and</p><p>ii. reflect on everything that has happened since the past few months</p><p>lets get into it.</p><h3><b>april '25 - july '25</b></h3><p>when i was in my third year of college, i landed an internship with an indian search fund which was founded by a stanford alum. we were one of the first search funds who were looking to raise in india (for real). i was among the five interns who were selected for this role from around 1600+ total applicants i.e a selection rate of 0.31%. like anyone, i was insanely thrilled. how many people get the opportunity to break into pe and work with a stanford alum that too while being in college. this was maybe the biggest opportunity i had gotten in my life until that point and it was euphoric.</p><p>i joined the fund and began working immediately. this role ended up being one of if not the most influential and important experiences of my professional lives. the learning curve was insane and i got to know and experience the very ins and outs of the world of private equity and search funds. i also met & worked with some of the most cracked people in the fund who were my co-interns who are still my friends.</p><p>i graduated in april '25 and i was waiting for them to give me a ppo since i had chosen to forgo my campus placements. when i entered my third year, i quickly decided that i would not sit for placements. the primary reason behind this was that i wanted to spend the next few years of my life/career working in smaller companies/startups where i could directly create impact instead of working in multi-national companies that came to my college for hiring that had thousands of employees.</p><p>larger companies have a big chain of hierarchies and it takes a long time for your actions to actually get translated into real impact. this and a lot of reasons due to which larger companies, despite having a fuck ton of money move extremely slower compared to startups.</p><p>suppose you are an intern in a company like TCS. now no matter how hard you work in those 3/6 months, the odds of you making an actual impact for tcs are astronomically low. the same goes for the odds of you meeting the ceo/chairman of tcs personally no matter how hard you work.</p><p>compare that with interning at an idea/pre-seed/seed stage startup. startups like these will mostly have an employee size of anywhere between 1-50 people. if you work very hard in a startup even if you are an intern, you could directly create an insane amount of impact for them be it landing new clients, fixing up certain processes and so on. you could work directly under the founder of the startup and he/she might even reward you with a full-time gig in the company post your internship. if you stay in the company for >4years, you could even rise up in the ranks to become an integral member of the startup's core team.</p><p>by choosing to forgo campus placements for potentially working in a startup, i was taking an asymmetrical bet. asymmetrical bets are bets that provide an outsized reward directly proportional to the risk taken. higher the risk taken - higher the potential reward.</p><p>working in an early stage startup is an asymmetrical bet. you can get rich very quickly through esops, rise up the company ranks due to your performance, etc but you are also taking a higher risk. your company could potentially shut down, your esops could go to zero, you might have to take a pay cut/forgo a month(s) of your salary in case the startup faces a cash crunch or even get laid off. compare that to a corporate job where most of these risks get eliminated but then you cannot really get promoted quickly or see a huge increase in your salary in a relatively short amount of time or even get equity in the company.</p><p>i had been applying for jobs in startups, vc & ib firms since roughly march even though i was still working with the search fund. mainly because the prospects of the search fund seemed very low. i was actually able to land my first full-time offer in april itself. it was an analyst role in a small vc firm of barely 10-11 people but the pay was kind of below par the market level or so i thought at that point in time.</p><p>apart from the sub par pay, they wanted me to relocate on a week's notice and i felt that it was too soon for me. a part of me was also warning myself of not accepting the offer because i shouldn't accept the first offer that came my way since i could potentially end up landing a better offer in the future. a mixture of these reasons and more, i ultimately ended up declining that offer which in hindsight was actually pretty good.</p><p>i dont really regret it so to say since i myself made that choice after thorough consideration but i often find myself reflecting on how vastly different my life could have been had i accepted that offer. who knows, maybe it could have been way better for me. but you can never connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.</p><blockquote>the universe has a way of leading you to where you are supposed to be at the moment you are supposed to be there.<br>- mib international (2019)</blockquote><p>after rejecting that offer, the founders of the pe firm officially offered me a ppo and even though i didnt really want to work there anymore, i still had some hope left so i joined them. more importantly than that, i had received equity in the fund. a total of 22 lakhs of equity in the search fund. yes 22 lakhs.</p><p>initially, it felt great. who wouldnt feel great? the ppo and the equity also proved my hypothesis/choice of not sitting for college placements to work at a startup. but slowly as time went by, it was clear that the fund was probably not going anywhere.</p><p>by the end of may, it was painstakingly clear to me that the founders were not really committed to the fund. for a long time, they had been treating the search fund more like a side project. they were barely giving it time, already had full-time jobs & they were simply not going all in. i already knew this since i was 5-6 months into the role but i kept hoping that things would keep getting better with them.</p><p>even after it was clear that there is no future for this fund, i had still not left it since i had so much equity + i was still applying to startups and hoping to land another role before i sent in my resignation (which i wasnt even sure of). but then one day, i had an argument with the founders and it was the breaking point for me. i finally left the fund and yeah i pretty much ended up burning my bridges with them. i do regret how i handled the situation but a lot of it was my fault too.</p><p>in hindsight, i should have definitely left earlier. it was a ticking time bomb and i was just trying to drag it out till the end due to job security, the equity and the paycheck, constantly hoping things would get better. but I learned my lesson(s) there.</p><h3><b>aug '25 - sept '25</b></h3><p>after i left the firm, i never felt so much lighter. it was amazing. its insane how badly a toxic or unfulfilling job/relationship can bog you down without you even realizing. we always imagine that if we choose to walk away from it, we will be devastated but honestly, the reality is quite the opposite. in my case, i literally walked away from 22 lakhs of equity yet i could not have felt any more lighter and free.</p><blockquote>we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.<br>- seneca</blockquote><p>for a week or two, i was just chilling and thinking about my next move. i wasnt really applying anywhere but mostly i was thinking of maybe finally starting something of my own. a startup, a side project, an experiment - i hadn't given it a title as such.</p><p>one of my co-interns at the same search fund who had left earlier than me had joined another private equity holding firm. it was basically a startup and a pretty exciting one honestly. my friend offered to refer me to his founder and before i knew it, i met with him and i decided to join the firm.</p><p><i>(it was my first time experiencing the power of personal networks. i got into this firm because of my friend's referral even though there was no official job posting on any social media app/channel. nothing can really beat referrals and/or the power of personal networks).</i></p><p>it was an amazing role and an insane opportunity for someone my age. a while back, the firm had acquired a content newsletter for $10,000. the newsletter was focused on computer science students in the us and had over 50k subscribers. the issue was that the newsletter was lying around dormant since no one was running it due to which it was severely under monetized.</p><p>i was gonna work as a founder-in-residence at the firm where i would be taking over the daily operations of the newsletter and also be tasked with monetizing & growing the newsletter so that we could sell it for a decent profit. again, i received a chunk of equity in the newsletter and the profits from sponsorships that i would be able to bring in. i was running a business without really owning any of the risks associated with it. it was an incredible opportunity.</p><p>cut to around 28 days later, it was clear to me that this wasn't really my cup of tea. content is not one of my strengths and i found myself not really caring for the newsletter which was focused on comp science (another area that i wasnt really interested in).</p><p>it wasnt just the reasons above. i very quickly realized that this was like a repeat episode of my previous job where again i did not enjoy the work very much yet i was staying on just for the sake of it. a part of me was also just tired of working under someone. a second part of me was done working in private equity. another part of me wanted to start something of my own.</p><p>a combination of these reasons, and i left my second job within a record 28 days. at that time, my closest friends called me crazy. hell even a part of me felt that i was throwing away a huge opportunity for nothing. but i had insane clarity on what i felt was best for me. and looking back, it was certainly the best decision i could have made then.</p><h3><b>october '25 - present</b></h3><p>fresh out of a job, i decided to finally pursue my idea/side-project/startup whatever you want to call it. i started brainstorming with Ilms on how i should go ahead building it and began working on it.</p><p>so here's what i have been working on since the last 2 weeks. i'm building "grantsy" - a one stop destination for founders to discover and apply to world class startup grants, accelerators, fellowships & residencies.</p><p>as i decided on this idea for grantsy, i saw a post for a program hosted by the residency called delta. its a 21 days online program where founders work together to build their products/startups in public. i was wondering whether i should apply or not since i hadnt really made any progress on my idea but ended up submitting my application minutes before the form closed.</p><p>to my surprise, a day later, i learnt that i was selected for the program! it seemed crazy to me that just earlier, i had closed one door when i had quit my job and now another one had promptly opened.</p><p>and here i am, building grantsy alongside 600+ founders who are a part of the delta program, all working on their own startups in public.</p><p>it feels like a big risk "traditionally" speaking. im 21 years old in india without a job who is trying to build this project sitting at home. i dont even know how to code so how will i even end up making it? so on and so forth.</p><p>i remembered a tweet which harnidh kaur made recently which just strikes home.</p><div class="my-6 p-4 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg bg-gray-950/50"><p class="font-semibold text-white">Harnidh Kaur <span class="font-normal text-gray-500">@harnidhish</span></p><p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">Being a founder is the greatest inversion of Maslow's hierarchy.</p><p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">For years, your psyche is taught to climb from safety → stability → belonging → self-actualization.</p><p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">But the founder's choice is antithetical: you forgo the basics (comfort, security, predictability) so you can chase meaning and ambition instead.</p><p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">The hierarchy tells us only the most evolved and secure people get to do that. Yet founders attempt it from the bottom, building while hungry, unstable, and uncertain.</p><p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">Which is why, if you are a founder, it's both ridiculous that you are, and miraculous that you still choose to be.</p></div><p>bang on. being a founder is literally antithetical. you dive head first into uncertainty and instability to chase meaning & ambition. it is miraculous (or maybe borderline insane). and that's exactly what im doing. yes, i might fail and crash and burn. but its worth it. there is no better feeling than working on something that you deeply care about.</p><p>if you read this till the end, thanks! this blog was over 2300+ words - my longest piece yet. feel free to give me feedback on the blog or critique anything. if you want to discuss grantsy or anything else, reach out without hesitation. dms are always open. until next time.</p>`,

                    content: `<p>a lot of you might know or may have already seen the new superman movie that came out almost 2 weeks ago now. i recently went to see it a second time in theatres and i just couldn't help but write this blog on how well james gunn's portrayal of superman is.</p><p>i am a huge fan of superheroes, comics & primarily comic book movies (cbms). there's just something in these stories that feels so magical and relatable to me yet at the same time also feels so personal. i have been following the pursuits of both marvel studios and dc studios since as long as i can remember. apart from sam raimi, kevin feige, the russos, it can be argued that james gunn is one of the most important & influential people who is part of the reason behind the decades long success behind comicbook/superhero movies.</p><p>i still remember the time when gunn was abruptly fired by disney over some past offensive tweets made by him on topics such as pedophilia and rape. it was a shocking development during that time back in 2018 but if you had told people that just 4 years after his firing, gunn would become co-ceo of dc studios and 3 years after that would write and direct his own superman movie, people would have laughed at you. ironically in hindsight, disney's firing of gunn was quite possibly one of the best things that could have ever happened to the industry and to gunn himself.</p><h3><b>gunn & dc</b></h3><p>superman is one the most popular superheroes ever created in the history of comics. we can go so far as to say that superman is one of the most recognizable & popular fictional characters ever created. yet, when it came to his live action portrayal especially on the big screen, superman was arguably treated very poorly compared to his contemporaries such as spiderman/batman. a major part of it was warner bros' gross mismanagement of the dc ip as a whole where they were regularly failing to create well reviewed and financially successful cbms based on the dc characters.</p><p>after gunn's public firing in 2018, warner bros swooped in and asked gunn to write and direct a movie for dc. he had two options during that time he could make a superman movie or he could make a suicide squad movie. from a professional standpoint, it made absolute sense for gunn to choose superman right away. but gunn was hesitant because he did not have a strong vision for making a superman movie so he chose the suicide squad instead.</p><p>warner bros were impressed with gunn's suicide squad and his subsequent dc tv series peacemaker staring john cena. by 2022, it was clear to them that the only person who could do justice to the grossly mismanaged dc ip was james gunn. he was named co-ceo of dc studios alongside peter safran.</p><p>under the new dc studios regime, gunn knew there was only one character who could kickstart his new cinematic universe and it was superman. gunn took the job upon himself to not only write but also direct this new superman movie and now 3 years later after finally seeing gunn's superman, there is no doubt about the fact that gunn has cemented himself as the greatest comicbook movie director of all time.</p><h3><b>superman</b></h3><p>as the movie starts, we are immediately thrown into this new established world where superman has already announced himself to the public 3 years ago. i absolutely loved how gunn trusts his audiences and does not spend too much time on superman's or lex luthor's origin story. we are quickly introduced to the city of metropolis and the daily planet hq without wasting a moment and gunn makes this work in a very unusual way.</p><p>the strongest point of the entire movie is undoubtedly its cast. gunn's decision to recast henry cavill for david corenswet pays off handsomely. corenswet's portrayal of superman is already one of the best and he effortlessly slips into the role right from the opening scene. david's superman is so well written by gunn - he's a man who despite being the most powerful being on the planet, is so human and goofy and kind. rachel brosnahan's lois lane rightfully makes a remark that superman thinks that each and every person he meets is just the kindest & most beautiful being in the world and superman does not deny it in any way and says that "maybe thats the real punk rock."</p><p>in the first half of the movie, when lex holds krypto captive, superman turns himself in to the cops just so he could be with his dog. that is a very touching thing but what makes it even better is that towards the end of the movie, we come to learn that krypto was not even his dog instead he was caretaking him for his cousin kara aka supergirl.</p><p>superman saving a squirrel and a dog and not wanting to hurt the kaiju in the beginning is everything that makes this character great. corenswet's superman is so vulnerable and likeable that you just cannot help but root for him. what a generational casting man. i cant imagine that david corenswet and robert pattinson might never get to share screen together in the dcu.</p><p>the music, side characters, story, pacing, performances, action, everything is just chef's kiss man. gunn did it with guardians of the galaxy and then he did it with the suicide squad and then he did it with peacemaker and now he does it again effortlessly in superman.</p><p>gunn's choice of choosing teddybears' punkrocker for the movie's final scene & end credits is legendary. he never misses while choosing soundtracks for his movies man. the legendary come & get your love for gotg and now punkrocker for superman. absolutely genius. i love this trend of comicbook movies having such amazing end credits songs - we had am i dreaming for across the spiderverse, all the stars for black panther, venom for venom (2018), fire in the sky for shang chi and of course gunn continuing the trend with punkrocker for superman.</p><p>i love superheroes man. thank you, james gunn. onto the fantastic four now!</p><p>update: saw the fantastic four and yeah it slapped. two amazing superhero ips revived at the same time. superheroes are back!</p>`,

                    title: "hypothetical - what if you got into iim-a and did not sit for placements?",
                    date: "2025-06-09",
                    content: `<p>this is a pretty interesting hypothetical scenario that i have been thinking about for quite a while. let's start from the beginning. you just gave the cat exam and you have received an interview call from iim ahmedabad, considered by many as the greatest business school in this country. you're nervous yet excited but you have done the work. you begin your interview preparations to absolutely obliterate the interview panelists in the interview.</p><p>the day has finally come. you reach the venue more than 30-45 minutes early. you take a seat in the waiting area and try to focus on keeping your cool. you're confident of your preparation. at the same time, your heart is beating crazy fast. your entire career depends on this one interview. this interview might very well be the turning point of your personal & professional life. everything hinges on the next one hour. your name is called. you go inside and greet the interview panelists and take your seat. no turning back now. the interview begins. an hour goes by. you exit the building after completing your interview. the interview went well, you think. but you're not certain. only time will tell now.</p><p>cut to a few weeks later. you have been sitting on top of your inbox for every single day waiting for that one email that will decide your fate. one fine day, the email arrives. you see the notification and your heart stops. you open the email with your hands shaking. you've done it! congratulations! you have successfully secured admission at iim ahmedabad's flagship pgp-mba program!</p><p>after a couple of days, an absolutely mind numbing news reaches your ear. you cannot for the life believe it at first but it's official and it's very real. iim ahmedabad has just announced that they are permanently dissolving all of their placement committees and are stopping all placement drives effective immediately from this academic year. what the fuck? you say. you don't have any other b-school converts left so you have to make a decision. there goes your 50lpa mckinsey ppo down the drain.</p><p>sorry for the long build up folks (nah im lowkey proud of that), but here is your hypothetical scenario..</p><h3>what would you do if you got into iim-ahmedabad and could not sit for placements?</h3><p>as obvious as that question might appear, it's actually not that simple to answer. there are huge consequences that hinge on your decision. let's try to analyze all possible angles of this scenario and what could end up playing out depending on whether you choose to go to iim-a or not.</p><p>now you can't deny the power of a strong network right? by choosing to go to iim-a, you will have the chance of reliving college life, making lifelong friends and studying with some of the smartest brains in this country. the best of the best all in your classroom. you will gain access to an insane alumni network that you could tap into anytime and find opportunities that would be borderline impossible for a non iim graduate to find.</p><p>the flagship mba program at iim-a costs around 26 lakhs (excluding food, electricity & other utilities) give or take a few. any possibility of calculating a tangible roi is out of the question. there's no guarantee that you will graduate with a job let alone a high paying job. once you go there, you're all on your own.</p><p>on one hand, you will still have the safety net of having a tier-1 mba from the best iim in this country. you could just hit cold apply on hundreds of off campus jobs and you are sure to get a decent number of interview invites because of your freshly minted iim-a degree.</p><p>on the other hand, you're not really sure if shelling out 26+ lakhs is really worth it. if you're taking an education loan, its even harder for you to take a decision. you will have a 26+ lakhs ed loan (excluding interest btw) hanging over your head right after you graduate which will force you to play it safe in your life for at least the next 6-8 years.</p><p>you might as well buy a perplexity pro subscription to simulate a portfolio of fast growing small cap stocks and yolo this money like an absolute madlad (yeah no one's gonna do that but you get the gist). you could start your own startup and go all in with this money as your seed capital. the possibilities of utilising this money elsewhere are endless.</p><p>it also depends on what your risk profile is. if you happen to come from a well off family and you currently do not have any such family & financial responsibilities towards anyone, it might make absolute sense for you to go ahead and do it. if not, you will have to take a loan and as we discussed already, it remains a risky proposition in a scenario where you are not able to secure a high paying job.</p><h3><b>what happens in foreign b-schools?</b></h3><p>the first reason which prompted me to write about this hypothetical is the fact that foreign b-schools such as hbs, stanford gsb, iese, insead, etc do not have 'official' on-campus placements like the way indian b-schools do.</p><p>instead, these b-schools conduct a multitude of other activities that help their students find jobs once they graduate. for instance, regular career fairs are organized where students and recruiters can meet and network with each other and explore various job opportunities. various workshops are conducted by these b-schools on how to polish your cvs/resumes, how to nail interviews and so on.</p><p>every year select recruiters from areas like consulting, investment banking, etc still do like to come on campus and hire students directly but it's not guaranteed or centrally managed by the b-schools like in india.</p><p>apart from this, many top tier firms conduct annual off-campus placement drives specifically for hiring the graduates of a select b-school or the graduates of all m7 b-schools. even to just be eligible for these roles, you are required to come from a specific tier 1 b-school. students also have unparalleled access to the alumni networks & alumni associations of these b-schools through which they can take the help of their alumni to land roles.</p><p>another popular route for foreign b-school graduates is either to start their own startups or to pursue entrepreneurship through acquisition (eta) and launch search funds (a search fund is an investment vehicle through which the entrepreneurs or 'searchers' of the firm raise capital from investors to search and acquire a small business and then run it full-time for usually a period of 4-7 years before selling it off). the search fund model is seeing an increasing interest at these b-schools every passing year. i do see this model being replicated more in indian b-schools in the next 5 years or so.</p><p>basically, students at these schools are not guaranteed any placements. they have to work for it even harder than their indian counterparts. as you can see the entire placement process is quite different at these b-schools compared to indian b-schools. i came across this fact very recently and at first i could not believe my ears.</p><p>according to harvard's website, the annual cost of attendance for their mba program (2025-2026) is around $126,536. for a 2 year course, that's equal to roughly $253000 i.e. rs. 2.17 crores. that's actually insane. imagine enrolling in a b-school by paying 2.17 crores and you are not even guaranteed to get a job! well we don't have to imagine it in this case.</p><h3><b>when hypothetical meets real life at iim-a</b></h3><p>bhanu harish gurram, shrehith karkera and pawan kumar rai were three students studying at iim-a's pgp mba program in the batch of 2018. the three of them knew that the traditional 9-5 corporate grind was not made for them so they had been working on their startup idea of a newsletter that simplified financial & business news for students. after working on their startup for a while, bhanu, shrehith and pawan decided to go all in by doing one of the craziest things a person could ever do at a b-school. they chose to voluntarily opt out of iim-a's placement process and focus full-time on building their startup. the startup's name? finshots! at the time of taking this seemingly extreme step, bhanu, shrehith and pawan had a combined education loan of almost 60 lakhs and had only about 20k in their bank accounts.</p><p>bhanu, shrehith and pawan had also applied to one one of iim-a's fellowship programs called the "IIMAvericks" fellowship. this fellowship is open to all iim-a students and recent alumni who have recently started up on their own. the fellowship provides a monthly stipend to the entrepreneurs for two years so that the founders can fully focus on their ventures without having to worry about their finances.</p><p>how insane do you have to be in your heads to not sit for placements (voluntarily) at iim fucking ahmedabad. imagine watching all your friends get placed with seven figure offers at multinational firms while you're living off a monthly stipend building a startup. everyone will think you're crazy. mad props to these guys.</p><h3><b>what would i do?</b></h3><p>if i was presented with this hypothetical, i personally would still choose to pay the entire tuition fee of 26 lakhs and go for iim-a's mba program even if it meant that i could not sit for campus placements. i would get to live, study and work with some of the most brilliant minds in the country. i would get to make lifelong friends and acquaintances while getting a chance to relive college life. not to forget the brand and pedigree that the degree will bring with it.</p><p>we also saw how students studying in b-schools abroad are already living this hypothetical where they have to hunt and find their own jobs after putting in their own efforts. in my opinion, all of the above factors when coupled with each other far outweigh the tradeoff of not sitting for placements.</p><p>what would you guys do if presented with this hypothetical? would u pay 26 lakhs to go to iim-a and not sit for placements? or do you think that it won't be worth the huge financial investment? super curious to hear out everyone's opinions. hit me up with your thoughts/opinions on my linkedin or in the comments below and i'll get back to you. until next time folks and thanks for reading this 10 minute long blog!</p>`,

                    content: `<p>around 2 months ago, this one post started popping up on multiple instagram pages and reddit communities on “the startup reality check” comparing india and china on the basis of what the startups of each country are building. the post highlighted certain sectors and areas where indian startups are supposedly creating meaningless value for its people whereas china on the other hand is leading the charge in sectors such as ai, semiconductors, deeptech, etc. while i do believe that china is indeed building in these sectors at an impressive pace, i don’t believe the narrative that this post tries hard to paint regarding indian startups.</p><figure class="my-6"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L5VY1ynG/Ind-vs-China.png"><i>pic. in question that went viral on social media platforms.</i></figcaption></figure><p>it’s also kind of fascinating to see everything that unfolded after this specific post started getting crazy traction. because this post is effectively just pure “rage bait.” piyush goyal, our commerce minister made a speech referencing this exact post on how the indian youth is wasting their talents building ice-cream brands and food delivery startups instead of building deeptech companies for india. tens of physical posters and banners of this post were showcased at the startup mahakumbh 2025 and millions of indians started bashing indian consumer tech companies on reddit and other platforms.</p><p>its the general human tendency of people, especially on social media platforms (where herd mentality prevails) is to immediately react & comment negatively on these types of posts instead of taking the time to think about what’s actually the ground reality.</p><p>let’s take a minute ourselves and try to go through this post’s claims and also try to gauge the mentality of the person who made this particular post. firstly, this post is pro-china in the purest of sense and clearly only highlights the areas in which china is better than india and never the opposite (surprise)! secondly, this post has no real data/facts/statistics regarding its claims. its just generic statements made to incite hate and paint a specific narrative and it actually did end up succeeding in that. in fact, i wouldn’t even be surprised if this was made using a couple of prompts on an LLM. the person (or AI!) who made this post obviously did all of this intentionally because that’s what he or she may have actually set out to do.
</p><p>keeping all of this aside, i also want to address some of the post’s statements in favour of india. it’s not that founders aren’t building deeptech startups in india. its just that in comparison to consumer startups, deeptech startups get relatively less media coverage and limelight among the general public. let’s demonstrate this through a simple exercise. if you ask a random person to name three d2c/consumer brands, he/she will mostly be able to do it with ease. businesses such as boAt, Lenskart, Mamaearth, etc immediately come to mind. most people will even tell you the names of their founders.</p><p>compare that with deeptech startups. how many random people (or people you know) could actually name three indian deeptech startups? probably not many. deeptech startups by nature don’t advertise themselves on social media and television like the way consumer startups do. Zepto, Zomato, boAt can all put out tv ads for the entire country to see and entice them to buy their products (since they are consumer facing) whereas deeptech startups are mostly building for b2b use cases or are not directly consumer facing.</p><p>it’s disrespectful for all deeptech founders in india when statements like these go viral. india already has a very flourishing deeptech startup ecosystem. 18 y/o naman pushp at Airbound is building the world’s most advanced drones that can help reduce the cost of deliveries by 137x with potential use cases in the military as well. kshitij khandelwal & awais ahmed are building Pixxel in bengaluru since 2018 after graduating from BITS pilani, which is building a constellation of the world’s most advanced remote sensing satellites. vishrant dave, ayush ranjan and prateesh awasthi, three IIT kanpur undergrads are building Armatrix where they are creating next generation robots that have industrial & defence applications.</p><p>on the funding side of it, student vc firms like gradCapital & Campus Fund are raising and deploying millions of dollars to back ambitious youngsters (primarily undergrads) to go and build deeptech startups. harnidh kaur’s WTFund is out there pioneering non-dilutive equity grants for folks under 25 while PanScience Innovations in delhi is building india’s largest deeptech and AI startup studio. social alpha is another organization that is backing deep science companies that are risky and cannot often be venture backed with capital, operational and go-to-market support. the government too has active plans to create substantial allocations for deeptech startups from its 10,000Cr fund of funds. there is no shortage of deeptech startups that are building in india and for india.
</p><p>at the same time, i do believe that we need consumer startups as much as we need deeptech startups. just because consumer startups supposedly create less value than deeptech startups, it does not mean that indian founders should stop building consumer brands. even china has a booming ecommerce market valued at more than $2 trillion compared to india’s $130B (a huge difference). but that’s not the point.</p><p>comparing india with china is like comparing apples with oranges. piyush goyal’s statement that ice cream brands & grocery startups are not “real startups” is like martin scorsese saying marvel movies are not real cinema. thousands of filmmaking crew members earn a livelihood from these movies while at the same time, comic book movies and tentpole films keep the box-office alive, thus allowing theatre owners to showcase films that might not have a mass appeal but still be extremely artistic.</p><p>similarly, we need consumer brands to drive domestic consumption while at the same time providing employment opportunities to millions of gig workers and delivery personnel (not forgetting the amount of foreign capital it brings in as well). founders don’t have to choose between building deeptech companies and consumer brands. there is always room for both.</p>`,
